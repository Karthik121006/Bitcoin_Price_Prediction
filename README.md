**Bitcoin Price Predictor**
A machine learning-based Bitcoin price prediction application with a user-friendly graphical interface built using Python and Tkinter.
Overview
This application uses linear regression to predict Bitcoin prices based on historical price patterns. Users can input the last 3 days of Bitcoin prices and receive predictions for the next 7 days, complete with visualizations and detailed analysis.
Features

Simple GUI Interface: Easy-to-use desktop application built with Tkinter
Machine Learning Prediction: Uses scikit-learn's Linear Regression model
7-Day Forecasting: Predicts Bitcoin prices for the next week
Interactive Visualizations: Real-time plotting with matplotlib
Error Validation: Input validation and error handling
Performance Metrics: Displays model RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
Detailed Results Table: Shows day-by-day predictions with dates

HOW IT WORKS

Input Phase: Users enter Bitcoin prices from the last 3 days
Feature Engineering: The application creates technical indicators including:

Price changes (momentum)
3-day moving averages
Day-of-week patterns


Model Training: Trains on synthetic historical data that mimics real Bitcoin price patterns
Prediction: Uses the trained model to forecast prices for the next 7 days
Visualization: Displays results in both graphical and tabular formats

Requirements
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tkinter (usually comes with Python)
Installation

Clone or download the repository
Install required packages:
bashpip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Run the application:
bashpython bitcoin_predictor.py


Usage

Launch the Application: Run the Python script to open the GUI
Enter Price Data: Input Bitcoin prices for:

3 days ago
2 days ago
Yesterday


Generate Prediction: Click "Make Prediction" to analyze the data
View Results:

See tomorrow's predicted price prominently displayed
Review the 7-day forecast table
Analyze the trend visualization graph
Check the model's accuracy metric (RMSE)



Technical Details
Model Architecture

Algorithm: Linear Regression
Features: 8 technical indicators derived from price data
Training Data: Synthetic historical data with realistic Bitcoin price patterns
Validation: RMSE calculation for model performance assessment

Input Validation

Ensures all prices are positive values
Validates reasonable price ranges (1 - 1,000,000 USD)
Handles formatting issues (commas, dollar signs)

Error Handling

Comprehensive exception handling for all operations
User-friendly error messages
Graceful degradation if plotting fails

Limitations

Synthetic Training Data: Uses generated historical data rather than real market data
Simple Model: Linear regression may not capture complex market dynamics
Short-term Focus: Designed for 7-day predictions only
No External Factors: Doesn't account for news, market sentiment, or external events

Future Enhancements

Integration with real-time Bitcoin API data
More sophisticated ML models (LSTM, Random Forest)
Additional technical indicators
Longer prediction windows
Portfolio management features
Risk assessment metrics
